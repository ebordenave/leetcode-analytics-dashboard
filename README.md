# LeetCode Analytics Dashboard

This project aims to create a comprehensive analytics dashboard for LeetCode users, providing insights into their performance, progress, and areas for improvement. It utilizes a GraphQL server with Apollo Server to fetch data from the LeetCode API, and will eventually include a frontend for data visualization.

## Project Goals

The LeetCode Analytics Dashboard is designed to offer users a detailed view of their LeetCode journey, helping them track progress and identify areas for growth. Key objectives include:

1. Tracking day-to-day changes in ranking (positive or negative)
2. Visualizing ranking by region, state, or country
3. Analyzing performance across different skill areas (algorithms, data structures)
4. Identifying strengths and suggesting areas for upskilling
5. Providing insights into contest performance

## Features

- GraphQL API to fetch comprehensive LeetCode user data
- Daily ranking change tracking
- Regional and global ranking comparisons
- Skill area analysis based on problem tags
- Contest performance tracking

## Planned Features

- Interactive frontend dashboard for data visualization
- Personalized improvement suggestions based on performance analysis
- Graphical representation of skill areas and progress
- Detailed contest analysis and comparison
- Integration with learning resources for suggested upskilling areas

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed (version 12.x or higher recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed

## Installation

To install the LeetCode Profile GraphQL Server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-profile-graphql-server.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd leetcode-profile-graphql-server
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the GraphQL server:

1. Make sure you're in the project directory.

2. Start the server:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
   Or, if you've set up a start script in your package.json:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Once the server starts, you'll see a message like:
   ```
   ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000
   ```

4. Open the provided URL in your browser to access the GraphQL Playground.

5. In the Playground, you can run queries. To fetch the LeetCode profile ranking:
   ```graphql
   query {
     leetcodeProfile {
       ranking
     }
   }
   ```

6. Click the "Play" button or press Ctrl+Enter to execute the query.

7. To stop the server, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

## Configuration

The current implementation fetches the ranking for a hardcoded username ("ebordenave"). To change this, modify the username in the GraphQL query within the `leetcodeProfile` resolver in `index.js`.

## Future Development: Frontend

A frontend application to display the LeetCode profile data is planned for future development. This will provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the GraphQL API.
